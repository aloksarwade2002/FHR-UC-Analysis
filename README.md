# FHR and UC Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and Uterine Contractions (UC) data to provide insights into fetal health. It includes functionalities for plotting FHR and UC over time, calculating average FHR in specified epochs, and detecting uterine contraction peaks.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Plots FHR and UC data over time for visual analysis.
- **Epoch Calculation**: Computes average FHR over specified time epochs.
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies peaks in uterine contraction data and calculates their average duration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
##**Output**
The application will generate:
Plots for FHR and UC over time.
Average FHR values for each epoch.
Peak information for uterine contractions, including the number of wide peaks and their average duration.
